## Importing the React Native plugin

In order to use the FullStory Native Mobile SDK from within a React Native app, importing the React Native plugin is all that is required.

### Importing Example

Here's an example of importing the SDK in a React Native app.

```JSX
import FullStory from '@fullstory/react-native';
```

## Configuring for Expo

> This package cannot be used in the "Expo Go" app because [it requires custom native code](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/customizing/).

Add the config plugin to the plugins array of your `app.json` or `app.config.json`

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "@fullstory/react-native",
        {
          "version": "1.28.0",
          "org": "ABC"
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Plugin Props

Plugins allow for extra customization by passing in an object with properties. If no extra properties are added, defaults will be used. **Certain properties are required.**
